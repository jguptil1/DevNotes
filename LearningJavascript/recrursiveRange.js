//We have defined a function named rangeOfNumbers with two parameters. 
//The function should return an array of integers which begins with a number represented by the startNum parameter 
//and ends with a number represented by the endNum parameter. 
//The starting number will always be less than or equal to the ending number. 
//Your function must use recursion by calling itself and not use loops of any kind. 
//It should also work for cases where both startNum and endNum are the same.


//example output: [1,2,3,4,5]


function rangeOfNumbers(startNum, endNum) {
    //base case
    if(){
        return [];
    } else {
        const rangeArray = rangeOfNumbers()
    }
